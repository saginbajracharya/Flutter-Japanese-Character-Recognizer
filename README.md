# Flutter Japanese Language Character Half-Width and Full-Width Characters Recognizer

# Overview
The Flutter Japanese Language Character Half-Width and Full-Width Recognizer is a tool or utility designed to detect and handle half-width and full-width characters in Japanese text. In the context of Flutter, this recognizer can be used to differentiate between these two types of character formats, which is important for applications that handle Japanese language input or display, such as chat applications, form validations, or text processing tools.

# What Are Half-Width and Full-Width Characters?

- Full-width characters (zenkaku) are the standard format for most Japanese characters, including hiragana, katakana, and kanji, as well as punctuation marks. They take up double the width of ASCII characters and are used in normal Japanese text.

- Half-width characters (hankaku) are narrower characters used in digital environments where space is limited. Typically, half-width versions are used for katakana, ASCII characters, and punctuation.
